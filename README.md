# HR Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee data to provide meaningful insights into workforce structure, attrition patterns, and job satisfaction.  
The dashboard focuses on helping the HR team understand which employee segments are at high risk of leaving, which departments need attention, and how demographic factors influence overall workforce stability.

SQL was used for initial extraction, cleaning, and validation of the HR dataset.  
Power BI was used for modelling the data, creating DAX-based KPIs, and building an interactive dashboard that allows HR stakeholders to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

## Objectives
1. Measure total employees, attrition count, attrition rate, and active workforce.
2. Analyze attrition across departments, genders, education fields, and age groups.
3. Evaluate job satisfaction across various job roles.
4. Study demographic distribution to support workforce planning.
5. Present insights through a clear and interactive dashboard to support HR decisions.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL + Power Query)
- Removed duplicate employee entries and invalid records.
- Standardized text fields such as gender, department, education, and job roles.
- Handled missing values in key columns like age and job satisfaction.
- Validated employee IDs and ensured correct attrition mapping.
- Converted date fields and calculated age groups where necessary.
- Loaded cleaned data into Power BI for modelling and KPI creation.

## Key KPIs Developed
- **Total Employees** – total workforce size.
- **Attrition Count** – number of employees who left the company.
- **Attrition Rate** – percentage of employees who left.
- **Active Employees** – employees currently working.
- **Average Age** – average age of the workforce.

These KPIs provide a high-level view of the organization’s workforce health.

## Dashboard Insights
1. **Department-wise Attrition**  
   Some departments show disproportionately high attrition, indicating potential workload issues or engagement challenges.

2. **Age Group Analysis**  
   Employees aged 25–34 represent the highest proportion of attrition, suggesting a need for stronger career development programs for early-career employees.

3. **Gender-wise Attrition**  
   Gender-specific attrition trends highlight workforce balance challenges and help identify areas for diversity-related interventions.

4. **Job Satisfaction Analysis**  
   Job satisfaction ratings vary significantly across job roles, helping HR focus on roles where employees feel less motivated or supported.

5. **Education Field Analysis**  
   Certain education backgrounds show higher attrition rates, helping HR refine hiring strategies and retention plans.

## Final Output
The final HR Analytics Dashboard presents:
- KPI cards for key HR metrics  
- Department-wise attrition charts  
- Age group and demographic distributions  
- Job satisfaction matrices  
- Gender and education-based segment analysis  

The dashboard helps HR teams quickly identify patterns, understand employee concerns, and create targeted strategies for improving workplace satisfaction and retention.
